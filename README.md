## General Information
- This assignment is about bike sharing system 
- A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. The company is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario. So, it has decided to come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown comes to an end, and the economy restores to a healthy state. 
- understand the factors on which the demand for these shared bikes depends. Specifically, they want to understand the factors affecting the demand for these shared bikes in the American market

## Conclusions
- Maximum no of bookings were in fall season, and in spring it was quite less that means people prefer to use bike share in case of fall summer and winter
-Business was gaining popularity over year there is increase in % of bike booking in 2019 than in 2018.
-From month 1-12 middle moths have maximum no of bookings , distribution follows bell curve
- In general in spring people doesnt book much of the bikes, rain has the highest number
2019 has more booking than 2018 i.e company is gaining popularity
May - Oct count of bike booking is very high
No significant difference observed in bike booking with respect to each day
Working day has more bike booking than non working day
- it can be seen that upto 6000 of registered user books bike share this no decreases in case of casual user 3000
- Ultimately could build model upto prediction of 89%
